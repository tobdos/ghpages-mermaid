# ghpages-mermaid
Repo for testing the github pages feature with integrated mermaid graph rendering.  
Mermaid rendering is included on github itself but not yet on github-pages as it seems.
After the index.md is changed an action to render the svg is triggered and a new gh-page is built.

The action used is taken from [https://github.com/neenjaw/compile-mermaid-markdown-action](https://github.com/neenjaw/compile-mermaid-markdown-action)
